Shopping Cart Simulation

This project simulates a shopping cart application using Java and Spring Boot, designed to demonstrate the integration of APIs for managing products and user interactions. The application allows users to add, remove, and view items in their shopping cart. Additionally, it utilizes Docker to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent and efficient deployment environment. This project showcases my skills in backend development, API integration, and containerization practices.
